        Welcome to the page of Chromatic Carrot!
        <br>
        We are a small indie studio based in Rotterdam. Our mission is to make games that you can play in your own speed - no rush, take your time.
        <br>
        We are hobbyst, that means we don't have a big company support, in exchange we don't have the pressure to deliver fast. We release our games when they are ready.
